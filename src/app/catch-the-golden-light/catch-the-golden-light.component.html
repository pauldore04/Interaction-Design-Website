      <p>Our first concept was to create a multiplayer game where players would press the button as many times as possible within a specific time frame. The player who achieved more button presses would win. The LED would provide feedback by blinking once if Player 1 won or twice if Player 2 won.</p>

      <p>We explored alternative ideas, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A timing challenge where users would have to estimate a specific number of seconds accurately. We identified potential issues with providing clear user feedback and explaining the concept.</li>
        <li>A drinking game where participants would compete to finish a beer faster. Players would press the button at the start and again when finished.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We ultimately decided on creating a game called "Catch the Golden Light." In this game:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The LED cycles through various colors</li>
        <li>Occasionally, with a certain probability, the LED would display gold</li>
        <li>The user must press the button at the exact moment the gold color appears to win</li>
        <li>If pressed at the wrong time, the LED flashes red</li>
        <li>When the player wins, the LED remains gold</li>
        <li>After winning, the game resets and begins again</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We favored this concept because it was a simple game with an intuitive title that required minimal explanation.</p>

      <p>After settling on our concept, we created a simple flowchart to guide our programming process.</p>

      <p>We initially planned to use mob programming on a large display so everyone could contribute simultaneously. However, we encountered technical difficulties with the display.</p>

      <p>As a workaround, all four team members gathered around a single laptop to develop the code. This approach proved challenging as it limited true team collaboration.</p>

      <p>After our lunch break, we made some adjustments to the code and modified the colors to improve the game experience.</p>

      <p>Following a successful presentation of our project, we had the opportunity to see the creative ideas implemented by the other groups.</p>
