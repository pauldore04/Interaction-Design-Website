    <h2>What is Interaction?</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>Communication or direct involvement with someone or something. Can be action or influence.
        Interaction is action that happens between two or more things. These things could be human but also objects.
        It can happen from human to human, human to object and object to object. Interaction Design is a part of user
        experience design. Different from general interaction, interaction design focuses on the action between human
        and object. A action always has a goal and the process of interaction design is to reach that goal as best as
        possible. Important considerations when designing for user interaction are things like usability, accessibility
        and user needs, which all are components we’ve heard when talking about user experience design. I would think user
        experience design and interaction design aren’t too far apart from another. Constraints could be used to guide the
        users when interacting with something, you should probably try to make a object be very simple to use, so the
        users don’t experience any errors or feel overwhelmed when interacting with said object. Guiding the users isn’t
        easy and I would say there is no way to design interaction so that it suits everybody. Everyone is different and
        has different skills and knowledge, people are also used to different things. You can aim for including the widest
        range of users you can, but including everyone is probably close to impossible.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference and relation between Interaction and Interface?</h3>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>Interaction is how users engage with a system, while an interface is the framework that enables interaction.
        Interaction design and interface design are closely related „things“ that work together to create successful user
        experience. Interfaces are needed to make the interaction happen.</p>
